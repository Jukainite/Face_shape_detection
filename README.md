## Project Objective
This project aims to develop a function `detect_face_shape(image_path)` that can predict the face shape of the first detected face in an input image.

The project utilizes **MediaPipe** to detect facial landmarks and trains a **Random Forest** model to classify face shapes based on extracted landmark features.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Face Shape Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niten19/face-shape-dataset).

The dataset contains five different face shapes:
- Heart
- Oblong
- Oval
- Round
- Square

Data split:
- 800 images/class for training
- 200 images/class for testing
- Total: **5000 images**

## Feature Extraction
The project uses **MediaPipe** to detect **Face Mesh**, extracting key facial features:

### Key Features:
1. **Face Rectangularity**: Ratio of face area to the bounding rectangle area.
2. **Middle Face Rectangularity**: Ratio of middle face area to the bounding rectangle area.
3. **Forehead Rectangularity**: Ratio of forehead area to the bounding rectangle area.
4. **Chin Angle**: Angle between left chin, mid chin, and right chin.
5. **RBot (Lower face width / Middle face width)**: Ratio of lower face width to middle face width.
6. **RTop (Forehead width / Middle face width)**: Ratio of forehead width to middle face width.
7. **RTop - RBot**: Difference between the two ratios.
8. **fAR (Face width / Face height)**: Ratio of face width to face height.
9. **Left Cheek Width**: Distance from left cheek to left nose.
10. **Right Cheek Width**: Distance from right cheek to right nose.
11. **Right Cheek Angle**: Angle between facial landmarks related to the right cheek.
12. **Left Cheek Angle**: Angle between facial landmarks related to the left cheek.
13. **Face Length**: Distance from forehead to chin.
14. **Cheekbone Width**: Distance between cheekbones.
15. **Jawline Width**: Jawline width.
16. **Top Jaw Width**: Upper jaw width.
17. **Forehead Width (Eyebrow-based)**: Forehead width based on the distance between eyebrows.
18. **Chin Width**: Chin width.

## Model Training
A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on the extracted features, yielding the following results:

```

## Observations
The **Random Forest** model did not perform very well (Accuracy = 46%). Some possible reasons include:
- The extracted features may not be sufficient to clearly distinguish face shapes.
- The dataset may contain images that are difficult to classify.
- Random Forest may not be the best choice for this problem.
- ----> I may need more time to enhance this issue

## Alternative Solution
I experimented with **CNN - EfficientNet B4** (pretrained) and fine-tuned it on the dataset. Detailed training can be found here: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/phamkhacduy/test-shape-detection)

### CNN Model Results:
- **Accuracy**: 86.1%
- **Precision**: 85.58%
- **Recall**: 82.60%
- **F1-score**: 83.87%

### Performance Review:
✅ **High Precision (~85.58%)** → Model makes fewer incorrect predictions.

🟡 **Moderate Recall (~82.60%)** → Some faces may still be misclassified.

✅ **Good F1-score (~83.87%)** → Balanced between Precision and Recall.

## Conclusion
🔥 The CNN model significantly outperforms Random Forest.
📌 Recall can be improved if necessary.
📌 If real-world testing maintains accuracy, this model is suitable for deployment.

### Usage

#### To train the Random Forest model, follow these steps:

1. Run `Create_data.py` to preprocess and extract features.
2. Open and execute `Models_Training.ipynb` to train the Random Forest model.


#### To use the trained model for prediction you can refer to 2 `Main` jupyter notebook file or import the built-in function `detect_face_shape` by importing from the 2 model `.py` files !!

1. Import the function from the `.py` file from one of the models
```python
from Face_Shape_Detect_CNN import detect_face_shape
```
OR

```python
from Face_Shape_Detect_RF import detect_face_shape
```

2. Give the function an image path as input. You will get a string of the face shape
```python
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
predicted_shape = detect_face_shape(image_path)
print("Predicted Face Shape:", predicted_shape)
```
- **Input**: Image file path
- **Output**: A string representing the predicted face shape (e.g., "Oval", "Round", etc.)
